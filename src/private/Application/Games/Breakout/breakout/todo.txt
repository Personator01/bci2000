fewer rewards per strike early on in game (when there are many bricks and a low threshold)
more rewards later on (when it is harder to get them on both counts)
maybe start with higher PointsRequiredForReward (and maybe also higher MaxPointsPerStroke?)
	but reduce them both in proportion to the number of bricks left (not letting either of them get below 1.0)

states: GameDifficulty, StepSize, RunningThresholdEstimate

	do not calibrate
	set shift = -bias
	set scale = calibration factor
OR
	calibrate
	set shift = -bias
	set scale = 1.0
