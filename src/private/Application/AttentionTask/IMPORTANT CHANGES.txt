AttentionTask should be compiled with the GazeMonitorFilter now.

AllowedRadius has been removed from AttentionTask.  GazeMonitorFilter's FixationRadius is to be used instead and is now a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0 instead of 0 to 100.  Fixation radius is still in percentage of Screen Height

FixationCross has been removed from AttentionTask.  GazeMonitorFilter's FixationImage is to be used instead.

In order to run the experiment, GazeMonitorFilter's EnforceFixation must be enabled.  This means that fixation enforcement must be running to use the AttentionTask. (this was default behavior before)

UseEyetracker now does nothing and has been removed

BlinkTime now affects GazeMonitorFilter instead of AttentionTask.
SaccadeTime can also be tweaked in GazeMonitorFilter.
If either BlinkTime or SaccadeTime are violated, the fixation has been violated.
AttentionTask's AllowedTime dictates for how long the fixation can be violated before quitting the trial.
