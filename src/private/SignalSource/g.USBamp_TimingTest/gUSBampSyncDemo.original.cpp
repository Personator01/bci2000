/* gUSBampSyncDemo.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.
 *
 * This application reads data from multiple synchronized g.USBamp devices and writes received data to a binary output file.
 * This binary output file can be read by using MATLAB for example. The file consists of consecutive float values (4 bytes each) that are the read values in microvolts from the devices.
 * If you multiply the number of channels per device times the number of devices you get the number of channels for one complete scan. The file contains a number of those scans, one complete scan following the other.
 * Channel 1 of each scan represents the first channel of the first specified slave device in the slaveSerials array. All channels of the slave devices are in the order the slave devices were given in the array.
 * The values of the channels of the master devices are placed at the end of each scan. So the last value of each scan is the value of the last channel of the master device.
