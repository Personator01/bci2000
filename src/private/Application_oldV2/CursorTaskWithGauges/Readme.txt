CursorTaskMod RushRelease 1.0

Working version - no state outputs from application (terminated due to gaze leaving)
Thouroughly tested on one monitor - no dual monitor testing - should work however, same code as P3SpellerMod
Center Cross is fixed at 100 pixels regardless of screen size.  This should be noted.  If a size parameter is necessary, it can be added. No relative sizing is available due to GL restrictions
Only Allowed time parameter exists - blink time is redundant?  When the user blinks, it will simply register to the eyetracker as though the user is looking outside.  Since both measure the same thing, a shorter blink time is simply redundant.

Contact me for further help/bug reports/additions.  I will resolve as FAST as humanly possible over the next few days.  I am off-call 10/16/09 from 9:30 P EST to 12:30 P EST - any time else is fair game.
