      * @brief Interface for classes that can be sent to an implant to elicit electrical stimulation.
      *
      * This is a generic interface that is intended to be used with different types of implants with different 
      * stimulation capabilities each. Stimulation capabilities may vary regarding the number of channels used for 
      * stimulation, stimulation amplitude, form of the stimulation signal over time. To reflect this, a stimulation
      * command consists of a sequence of stimulation functions. A stimulation function can be composed arbitrarily
      * complex.
      *
      * Typical usage of an IStimulationCommand:
      * 1. Create an empty stimulation command instance.
      * 2. Repeatedly add IStimulationFunction instances.
      * 3. Send IStimulationCommand instance to implant by calling IImplant::startStimulation().
      *
