    /**
      * @brief A IStimulationFunction defines what stimulation signal is applied to which electrodes.
      *
      * An stimulation function consists of
      * - a sequence of IStimulationAtoms that can be repeated a number of times.
      * - and the information which electrodes to use for stimulation.
      *
      * Stimulation is usually applied between two points: one source electrode and one destination electrode (e.g., a 
      * ground electrode). Here, this concept is generalized to so-called 'virtual electrodes'. A virtual electrode is a
      * non-empty set of electrodes. It allows more degrees of freedom to shape the electric field of a stimulation.
      * These two sets have to be disjunct (because an electrode is either a source or a destination electrode, not 
      * both) and non-empty (because at least two electrodes are needed for stimulation).
      *
      * Each electrode is adressed with a positive integer index (i.e., uint32_t) and virtual electrodes are defined 
      * as sets of uint16_t (i.e., std::set<uint32_t>). Depending on the actual implant used, these indices may 
      * vary, starting with index 0. In addition, depending on the actually used implant, the electrode indices and the allowed combinations of
      * electrodes into virtual electrodes may differ. Please refer to the documentation of the used implant for more 
      * details on this.
      *
      * Typical usage:
      * 1. create IStimulationFunction instance with an IStimulationCommandFactory.
      * 2. Add an atom to the stimulation function.
      * 3. Repeat 2. until all atoms are added.
      * 4. Set repetitions using setRepetitions().
      *
      * Please note that one function may only contain atoms of the same type (e.g., only rectangular atoms).
      *
